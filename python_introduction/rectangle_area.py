# Define variables
principal = 1000  # $1000
rate = 0.05       # 5% annual interest rate
time = 3          # 3 years

# Calculate simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the result
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")

# Define variables for rectangle dimensions
length = 10  # Length of the rectangle
width = 5    # Width of the rectangle

# Calculate area of the rectangle
area = length * width

# Print the result
print(f"The area of the rectangle is: {area}")
